This is a recipe app with a New Recipe button, Button button (from rab's example), and Recipe RESTful button.
Note: Change the IP addresses in frontend/AddRecipe.js, frontend/recipe-RESTful_frontend/App.js, and
frontend/button_frontend/App.js.

To run the app and test for New Recipe, go into the frontend subdirectory and run the comment "run start", 
then you should be able to navigate into New Recipe! Using another terminal window, run  the comment 
"npm run deploy" in backend/. Output is seen on the terminal, and added 
items (recipes or recipe_ingredients) go into the database of our schema:mca_s20_recipe.

To run the app and test for Button, go into the frontend subdirectory and run the comment "run start", 
for some reason you need to first navigate into New Recipe button before navigating into the Button button! 
Using another terminal window, run  the comment "npm run deploy" in backend/button-server-db/. 
Output is seen on the terminal, and added items (button_count or button_count) go into the database 
of our schema:mca_s20_recipe.
